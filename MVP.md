MVP (minimum viable product)

Original proposed dataset of top 10,000 apps replaced with dataset of 1,000,000+ apps released since 2010. 

Preliminary analysis on aggregate data points provides two early suggestions:
1) Develope an App (productivity tool, business, finance, lifestyle, etc.) rather than a Game
2) Aim for a content rating of "Everyone" instead of one of the age specific groups (Mature, Teen, etc.)

Futher refinement will determine the optimal category of app, paid or free, in app purchase or not, etc.
